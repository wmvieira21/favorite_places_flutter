# Favorite_places
The Favorite Places App is a Flutter application that allows users to save their favorite places by adding a title, a picture, and a location. 
The app integrates with Google Maps APIs for location services, uses native device features like the camera and GPS, and stores data locally using SQLite with the SQLite package. Users can view their saved places by selecting them from the home page.

### Features
* Add Favorite Places: Add a title, capture a picture using the device's camera, and select a location using Google Maps.
* View Favorite Places: View a list of all saved places on the home page. Tap on a place to see its details, including the title, picture, and location on a map.

### Native Device Features:
* Camera: Capture pictures directly within the app.
* GPS: Get the current location or select a location using Google Maps.

### Local Data Storage:
Data is saved locally on the device using SQLite (sqflite package).
